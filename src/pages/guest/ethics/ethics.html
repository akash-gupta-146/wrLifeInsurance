            If you are an expatriate in Cambodia and married to a Cambodian. What about your family in law? Do they already
            have a local medical cover? What happens in case of a big emergency to them? Finally who pays for it? Maybe you would
            be happy to have applied a micro insurance scheme for some determined big risks.
