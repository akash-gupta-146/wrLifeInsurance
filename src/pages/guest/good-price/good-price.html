      Each dollar spent every year in the insurance company or in any subsidiary brokerage by the insured is a point which gives
      shares in the global architecture. Each year the point value can increase. The insured can gain more points (if he
      wishes so) by bringing customers (2000 points per customer brought) or having a good claim ratio (500 points per year).
      The insured can gain, sell, give, share points or pay a part of his premium with points.

      Finally for some customers who help to have new customers, a big part (or all) their own premium will be given back or saved
      in their account.
